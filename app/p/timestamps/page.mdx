# Timestamps That Don’t Suck

<Name />

I recently released a small open source package called [`little-timestamp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/little-timestamp) - a tiny, opinionated timestamp formatter.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this came after seeing a [tweet](https://x.com/steventey/status/1928487987211600104) by [Steven Tey](https://x.com/steventey) outlining the ideal timestamp. His approach resonated with me. It's concise, human-readable, and aligns with how people perceive time. However, I couldn't find a lightweight package that implemented this out of the box. So, I built one.

## What It Does

`little-timestamp` provides a single function that formats timestamps into human-readable strings based on their age:

- Less than 1 second: `Just now`
- 1–59 seconds: `Ns ago`
- 1–59 minutes: `Nm ago`
- 1–23 hours: `Nh ago`
- Same year: `May 30`
- Previous years: `Dec 12, 2024`

## Usage

Install the package:

```bash
npm install little-timestamp
```

Then, use it in your project:

```typescript
import { formatTimestamp } from "little-timestamp";

// ...

const formatted = formatTimestamp(timestamp);
console.log(formatted); // e.g. "5m ago"
```

## Why It Matters

Timestamps are everywhere: feeds, notifications, and logs, and they play a crucial role in UX. By providing user-friendly time strings, `little-timestamp` helps users understand the recency of events at a glance.

This package is ideal for developers who want a simple, opinionated, zero-dependency solution without the overhead of larger libraries.

Unlike heavier alternatives like moment.js or date-fns, `little-timestamp` focuses solely on relative time formatting with zero dependencies and a tiny footprint.

## Try It Out

You can find `little-timestamp` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/little-timestamp). It's open source, lightweight, and ready to use in your projects.
